# Benchmarks üìù

## Multilingual Speech Recognition
We compared the performance of multilingual speech recognition between SenseVoice and Whisper on open-source benchmark datasets, including AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, Wenetspeech, LibriSpeech, and Common Voice. In terms of Chinese and Cantonese recognition, the SenseVoice-Small model has advantages.

</div>

## Speech Emotion Recognition

Due to the current lack of widely-used benchmarks and methods for speech emotion recognition, we conducted evaluations across various metrics on multiple test sets and performed a comprehensive comparison with numerous results from recent benchmarks. The selected test sets encompass data in both Chinese and English, and include multiple styles such as performances, films, and natural conversations. Without finetuning on the target data, SenseVoice was able to achieve and exceed the performance of the current best speech emotion recognition models.

<img src="image/ser_table.png" width="1000" />
</div>

Furthermore, we compared multiple open-source speech emotion recognition models on the test sets, and the results indicate that the SenseVoice-Large model achieved the best performance on nearly all datasets, while the SenseVoice-Small model also surpassed other open-source models on the majority of the datasets.

</div>

## Audio Event Detection

Although trained exclusively on speech data, SenseVoice can still function as a standalone event detection model. We compared its performance on the environmental sound classification ESC-50 dataset against the widely used industry models BEATS and PANN. The SenseVoice model achieved commendable results on these tasks. However, due to limitations in training data and methodology, its event classification performance has some gaps compared to specialized AED models.

</div>

## Computational  Efficiency

The SenseVoice-Small model deploys a non-autoregressive end-to-end architecture, resulting in extremely low inference latency. With a similar number of parameters to the Whisper-Small model, it infers more than 5 times faster than Whisper-Small and 15 times faster than Whisper-Large.

# Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<a name="Usage"></a>
# Usage

## Inference

Supports input of audio in any format and of any duration.

```python
from funasr import AutoModel
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model_dir = "FunAudioLLM/SenseVoiceSmall"


model = AutoModel(
    model=model_dir,
    vad_model="fsmn-vad",
    vad_kwargs={"max_single_segment_time": 30000},
    device="cuda:0",
    hub="hf",
)

# en
res = model.generate(
    input=f"{model.model_path}/example/en.mp3",
    cache={},
    language="auto",  # "zn", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=True,
    batch_size_s=60,
    merge_vad=True,  #
    merge_length_s=15,
)
text = rich_transcription_postprocess(res[0]["text"])
print(text)
```

Parameter Description:
- `model_dir`: The name of the model, or the path to the model on the local disk.
- `vad_model`: This indicates the activation of VAD (Voice Activity Detection). The purpose of VAD is to split long audio into shorter clips. In this case, the inference time includes both VAD and SenseVoice total consumption, and represents the end-to-end latency. If you wish to test the SenseVoice model's inference time separately, the VAD model can be disabled.
- `vad_kwargs`: Specifies the configurations for the VAD model. `max_single_segment_time`: denotes the maximum duration for audio segmentation by the `vad_model`, with the unit being milliseconds (ms).
- `use_itn`: Whether the output result includes punctuation and inverse text normalization.
- `batch_size_s`: Indicates the use of dynamic batching, where the total duration of audio in the batch is measured in seconds (s).
- `merge_vad`: Whether to merge short audio fragments segmented by the VAD model, with the merged length being `merge_length_s`, in seconds (s).

If all inputs are short audios (<30s), and batch inference is needed to speed up inference efficiency, the VAD model can be removed, and `batch_size` can be set accordingly.
```python
model = AutoModel(model=model_dir, device="cuda:0", hub="hf")

res = model.generate(
    input=f"{model.model_path}/example/en.mp3",
    cache={},
    language="zh", # "zn", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=False,
    batch_size=64, 
    hub="hf",
)
```

For more usage, please refer to [docs](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR/blob/main/docs/tutorial/README.md)

### Inference directly

Supports input of audio in any format, with an input duration limit of 30 seconds or less.

```python
from model import SenseVoiceSmall
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model_dir = "FunAudioLLM/SenseVoiceSmall"
m, kwargs = SenseVoiceSmall.from_pretrained(model=model_dir, device="cuda:0", hub="hf")
m.eval()

res = m.inference(
    data_in=f"{kwargs['model_path']}/example/en.mp3",
    language="auto", # "zn", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=False,
    **kwargs,
)

text = rich_transcription_postprocess(res[0][0]["text"])
print(text)
```
